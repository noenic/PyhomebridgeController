# PyhomebridgeController
A python wrapper using the Homebridge UI API.

- You can use this library to control your Homebridge UI instance from python.<br>
- You will need to have the Homebridge UI installed on your Homebridge instance and the -I flag enabled.<br>
- Use your UI credentials to login, you can also create the first user with this library.
```py
from HBController import *
HB=HBController(username="username",password="password",IP_adress="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",port="8581",secure=False,otp=None,firstUser=False)

# secure = True if you use https (secure connection)
# otp = None if you don't use 2FA 
# firstUser = True if you want to create the first user (if the instance has not already been setup)
# Note that the username and password will be used to create the first user and return the same HBController object
# once the first user has been created, you can no longer use the firstUser argument 

#You can then access the submodules like this:
HB.Plugins.method()
HB.Config.method()
HB.Accessories.method()
HB.Users.method()
#etc...
```




# Accessories
You can use the class HBAccessories to get all the accessories and their informations, or to change the value of a characteristic of an accessory.
- You will need to know the uniqueId of the accessory you want to access, you can get it with the method `get_all_accessories` or if you know the name of the accessory you can use the attribute `accessories` which is a dict with the name of the accessory as key and the uniqueId as value.<br>

| Method name | Arguments | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_all_accessories` | None | Retrieves all accessories from Homebridge and returns a dictionary with all accessory information |
| `get_accessorie` | `uniqueId`: str | Retrieves an accessory using its `uniqueId` from Homebridge and returns a dictionary with all the accessory information |
| `get_layout` | None | Retrieves the layout of the accessories from Homebridge UI (user-dependent) and returns a dictionary with the layout of the accessories |
| `set_accessorie` | `uniqueId`: str, <br> `characteristicType`: str, <br> `value`: str | Sets a value to a characteristic of an accessory using its `uniqueId`, `characteristicType`, and `value`, and returns the old value of the characteristic |
| `get_characteristics` | `uniqueId`: str | Get all the characteristics of an accessory `{characteristics : value}` |

```py
#Get all accessories and their informations (dict)
print(HB.Accessories.get_all_accessories())  

#Get the arrangement of the accessories in the virtual rooms of Homebridge
print(HB.Accessories.get_layout())

#Get the informations of a specific accessory (dict) with  its id
print(HB.Accessories.get_accessorie("da02010c7c04998675990eacffcb3499b34bab66aac880b036787414bbb5d92b"))

#For easier use, the class HBAccessories has an attribute "accessories" which is a dict with the name of the accessory as key and the uniqueId as value
light=HB.Accessories.accessories['stripe-e2f9dd'] #= da02010c7c04998675990eacffcb3499b34bab66aac880b036787414bbb5d92b

#Get the characteristics of an accessory
print(HB.Accessories.get_characteristics(light).keys()) # The characteristics is the key and the value is the current value of the characteristic
#for this light the characteristics are: ['On', 'Brightness', 'Hue', 'Saturation', 'ColorTemperature', 'SupportedCharacteristicValueTransitionConfiguration', 'CharacteristicValueTransitionControl', 'CharacteristicValueActiveTransitionCount']
#This doesn't mean we can change all of them, for example we can't change the CharacteristicValueTransitionControl

#Let's try to turn on the light
print(HB.Accessories.set_accessorie(light,"On",1)) #Turn on the light


#Let's try to change the color of the light to green using the Hue and Saturation characteristics
print(HB.Accessories.set_accessorie(light,"Hue",120)) #Set the Hue to 120Â°
print(HB.Accessories.set_accessorie(light,"Saturation",100)) #Set the Saturation to 100%
```
**Note that every accessory available in homebridge is accessible and controllable here**<br>
**Also note that the characteristics are not the same for every accessory, for example the light doesn't have a "TargetTemperature" characteristic, like a thermostat does.**<br>



# Backup
The class HBBackup allows you to manage the backups of your Homebridge instance. You can download, upload,restore backups, and get the next scheduled backup.

#You can also set a custom directory to save the backup to, or leave it blank to save it to the current working directory.
print(HB.Backups.download_backup(filename="backup-2021.tar.gz",dir="/home/pi/"))


#You can get the next scheduled backup time 
print(HB.Backups.get_next_scheduled_backup())


#You can get all the backups that have been generated by Homebridge Config UI X
print(HB.Backups.get_generated_backups())

#After that you can download a specific backup by passing the backup ID.

print(HB.Backups.download_specific_backup(id="0E341EEC85C2.1676677018741",filename="backup-2021.tar.gz",dir="/home/pi/"))

#You can upload a backup to Homebridge Config UI X
# /!\ This will overwrite the current Homebridge instance with the backup you upload. (credentials, plugins, config.json, etc.)/!\
# /!\ Also note that it doesn't work for now (bug in the API) /!\
print(HB.Backups.upload_backup("/home/pi/backup-2021.tar.gz"))

#Once you have uploaded a backup, you can trigger a restore from the backup you uploaded.
print(HB.Backups.trigger_backup_restore())

- You will need to know the real name of the plugin you want to access. <br>
for example, the plugin `Homebridge UI ` is actually called `homebridge-config-ui-x` on the NPM registry. <br>

#Get the config section of a plugin (plugin needs to be installed)
print(HB.Config.get_plugin_config("homebridge-yeelight-wifi"))

#Replace the config section of a plugin (plugin needs to be installed)
print(HB.Config.replace_plugin_config("homebridge-yeelight-wifi",[{"platform":"yeelight","name":"Yeelight","disableDeviceDiscovery":True,"devices":[{"name":"Yeelight","ip":"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx","model":"ceiling4","disableAutomaticLightDetection":True}]}]))

#Enable/Disable a plugin (plugin needs to be installed)
print(HB.Config.enable_plugin("homebridge-yeelight-wifi"))
print(HB.Config.disable_plugin("homebridge-yeelight-wifi"))

print(HB.Config.get_backup("1676756544816"))

#Delete all backups stored on your homebridge instance
print(HB.Config.delete_backup())

#A backup will be made everytime you change the config.json file. So if you want to save your current config.json file you can do it like this
#It will simply rewrite the config.json file with the same content (so it will make a backup)
print(HB.Config.rewrite_config(HB.Config.get_config()))
```

#On Docker Hosts
print(HB.Platform.restart_docker_container())

#This will return the startup script for the docker container.
print(HB.Platform.get_docker_startup_script())

#You can set the startup script for the docker container with the following command: be careful, this will overwrite the current startup script.
print(HB.Platform.set_docker_startup_script("apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3"))

#Get the startup flags for the Homebridge service (like HOMEBRIDGE_INSECURE -I)
print(HB.Platform.get_startup_flags())

#Set the startup flags for the Homebridge service
